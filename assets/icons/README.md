Place the single app logo file here and name it `new_logo.png` (default).

If you want to use a different filename, update the `app_logo` setting in the app settings (configs/settings.json) or change the default in `src/core/settings_manager.py`.

Build scripts will generate `app_icon.ico` from this logo during packaging.
